An app that allows you to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes (or any other character of your choosing).

## Description
Hero Squad is an application that allows users who interact with it to create heroes and squads that contain a particular number of heroes such as killing squad or intelligence squad. Heroes can be affiliated with only 1 squad at a single time, therefore if the hero was to switch to another group, their name should not be present in the previous squad that they were in.
Also the project covers the objects within objects concept. You have to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes (or any other character of your choosing). By that you have to have evey hero created be assigned to a squad. Keep in mind no database was configured on this application and data is lost the moment you reload the application.
